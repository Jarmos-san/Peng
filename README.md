# Peng

Peng (I assume there's no meaning behind the name) is the name of the theme I designed myself for my [blog](https://jarmos.netlify.app). Feel free to use it for your blog & if you use Pelican to create the static content as well.

**Note**: It's a work-in-progress project, so you might want to look out for any updates. Steps to use this theme will be made available **VERY** soon.
